# EverydayTools
These are some of the tools I use almost every day for working with data and plotting. A lot of the code dates back to when I hardly knew what I was doing, so it's not tidy at all and often it's quite convoluted, but it gets the job done. The most useful module is probably nicePlots which provides wrappers to matplotlib.pyplot that ensure a consistent and elegant feel to the figures it makes.
